# Koda Pro app icon

A white **K** on a black rounded tile: the Koda Pro mark (a trademark of the owner, see
[LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt); not open source). It replaced FilmCraft's owl icon on 2026-10-15. The file
names still say `filmcraft` so the build, packaging and the upstream scripts keep working.

## Geometry

- A 512-unit viewBox tile, rounded square `rx=112`, black `#000000` full bleed, with the K in white
  `#ffffff` as one polygon, centred.
- The K was redrawn as a vector from the owner's 2000 px image (stem, arm and leg measured from the
  image and fitted as straight edges), so it stays sharp at every size.
- macOS renders (`filmcraft.icns`, `filmcraft-macos-512.png`) put the tile in Apple's grid (824 of
  1024 px, transparent margin). Windows, Linux and the web use the full-bleed tile.

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `filmcraft.svg` | canonical artwork, traced at 2048 px (about 1 MB) |
| `filmcraft-small.svg` | lighter trace at 1024 px (about 450 KB), for when size matters |
| `filmcraft-1024.png` | 1024 px render |
| `filmcraft-macos-512.png` | runtime Dock icon on macOS (embedded by `apps/filmcraft/src/main.rs`) |
| `filmcraft.icns` | macOS bundle icon (`CFBundleIconFile`) |
| `filmcraft.ico` | Windows icon, 16–256 px (embedded in `filmcraft.exe` by `apps/filmcraft/build.rs`) |
| `hicolor/<size>/apps/ai.storyteller.filmcraft.png`, `hicolor/scalable/…svg` | Linux icon theme, used by `packaging/linux/ai.storyteller.filmcraft.desktop` |

The web app's `apps/filmcraft-web/web/favicon.png` (128 px) comes from the same artwork.

## How the icon reaches each OS

- **macOS:** the window icon set at startup (`ViewportBuilder::with_icon`) is the Dock and app-switcher
  icon when the app runs unbundled. A future `.app` bundle points `CFBundleIconFile` at `filmcraft.icns`.
- **Windows:** `build.rs` embeds `filmcraft.ico` as the exe's resource icon (Explorer, Start menu,
  pinned taskbar), and the runtime icon covers the window, taskbar and Alt-Tab.
- **Linux:** the runtime icon plus `with_app_id("ai.storyteller.filmcraft")`, which Wayland matches to
  the `.desktop` file. Install the `hicolor/` tree under `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/` and the desktop
  file under `/usr/share/applications/`.

## Regenerate

`packaging/icons.sh` (needs `resvg`; `iconutil` on macOS for the `.icns`; the `.ico` is packed by
`cargo xtask ico`). To change the artwork, replace `filmcraft.svg` and `filmcraft-small.svg`, then run the
script. Every derived file needs its `.attribution` sidecar
and a row in `ATTRIBUTION.md`.
